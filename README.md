This repository contains tutorials detailing quantitative methods for gender-based violence prevention research. The folder Tutorial gives example code for the baseline analysis of a cluster-randomized trial, which evaluates the impact of a gender-based violence prevention program. An R Markdown file in the Tutorial folder walks through the basic data analysis, including generated datasets (with no private or real information) so that users can follow along and explore on their own. 

The folder Spatial_Statistics contains a tutorial for pulling and analyzing GPS data to predict neighborhood safety, as well as code that generates a dummy dataset of survey responses. This again allows users to follow along, while protecting the privacy of survey participants. 

The baseline analysis papers can be found at https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0213359 and https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077801219886380. We would be happy to share a working draft of the paper describing the spatial statistics methods and results upon request.
